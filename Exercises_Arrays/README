1.	 Consider an array MARKS[20][5] which stores the
marks obtained by 20 students in 5 subjects. Now
write a program to

student.

(c)	 find the number of students who have scored
below 50 in their average.

(d)	 display the scores obtained by every student.

	 2.	Write a program that reads an array of 100
integers. Display all the pairs of elements whose
sum is 50.

the elements of a two-dimensional array.

	 6.	Write a program to read and display a square
(using functions).

	 7.	Write a program that computes the sum of the
elements that are stored on the main diagonal of
a matrix using pointers.

	 8.	Write a program to add two 3 X 3 matrix using
pointers.

	9.	 Write a program that computes the product of the
elements that are stored on the diagonal above the
main diagonal.

	10.	 Write a program to count the total number of non-
zero elements in a two-dimensional array.

    11.	 Write a program to input the elements of a two-
dimensional array. Then from this array, make two
arraysâ€”one that stores all odd elements of the
two-dimensional array and the other that stores
all even elements of the array.

	 12.	 Write a program to read two floating point number
arrays. Merge the two arrays and display the
resultant array in reverse order.

second biggest and the second smallest number in
the array.

a p  X  q  X  r matrix. Also, find the sum, transpose,
and product of the two p  X  q  X  r matrices.

	 15.	 Write a program that reads a matrix and displays
the sum of its diagonal elements.

the sum of the elements above the main diagonal.
		(Hint: Calculate the sum of elements A ij where i<j )

	 17.	 Write a program that reads a matrix and displays
the sum of the elements below the main diagonal.
		(Hint: Calculate the sum of elements A ij where
i>j )

	 18.	 Write a program that reads a square matrix of size
n  X  n . Write a function int isUpperTriangular
(int a[][], int n) that returns 1 if the matrix
is upper triangular.
		(Hint: Array A is upper triangular if A ij = 0 and
i>j )

	 19.	 Write a program that reads a square matrix of size
n  X  n . Write a function int isLowerTriangular
(int a[][], int n) that returns 1 if the matrix
is lower triangular.

i<j )

	 20.	Write a program that reads a square matrix of
size n  X  n . Write a function int isSymmetric
(int a[][], int n) that returns 1 if the matrix
is symmetric. (Hint: Array A is symmetric if A ij =
A ji for all values of i and j )

	 21.	 Write a program to calculate XA + YB where A and
B are matrices and X = 2 and Y = 3 .

	 22.	 Write a program to illustrate the use of a pointer
that points to a 2D array.
	 23.	 Write a program to enter a number and break it
into n number of digits.

	 24.	 Write a program to delete all the duplicate entries
from an array of n integers.

	 25.	 Write a program to read a floating point array.
Update the array to insert a new number at the
specified location.
